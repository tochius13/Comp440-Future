APPLICATION DESIGN UPDATE:


Add Process Flow
Add your tool name /api name/team name on top of the assignment
Create content based on the accessibility
Look into alternate APIs as well and keep them as an option for later
 

For this milestone your group will work out in detail the design of your app. You will use a diagramming tool like Pencil Links to an external site., figma Links to an external site., justinmind Links to an external site., balsamiq Links to an external site., mockflow.com Links to an external site., or just your favorite paint program . If you are building a game or other widget-free app then a paint program will be easier to use.

Explore APIs  Browse all - Free APIs (free-apis.github.io) Links to an external site.

Your design should include:
Screens and Dialogs:

Create an image for each major screen and dialog in your app.
Show all widgets in their proper placement.
Name each screen and provide text explaining how actions on one screen lead to other screens.
Widget-Free Apps:

Include diagrams for all major ‘areas’.
Provide animation stills detailing common animations
Use storyboards if they are more relevant to your game.
A process flow is a visual representation of the steps and decisions in a process, often depicted in a flowchart or diagram. It is the sequence of steps or actions that define how a task or project moves from start to finish.
Goals of the Design:
Usability: Think about the usability of your app. Simulate how a user might interact with it. A common method is to print the screens on sheets of paper of the correct size and shuffle them as you pretend to use the app.

Efficiency: Save time by making changes now. Adding or deleting a screen is much easier at this stage than after you’ve written the code.
