Description

Now that you're comfortable with your framework, write a document outlining the major parts of your code. The structure will depend on your chosen framework.

You must watch the 
Architecture Links to an external site.

 lecture before working on this milestone.


For a Web App:
Database Tables (Models).

Views: Describe each view.

Controllers: List them.

URLs: List URLs and what each one does.

Design Considerations
Think about your design deeply.

Go over common use-cases: Which methods will be invoked?

Ensure methods have references to all necessary objects.

Aim for decoupling: fewer references mean easier maintenance.

Deliverables

Add an Architecture document to the wiki. It should contain:

Languages/Frameworks/Libraries/Services/APIs: List and explain how they tie together.

Package/Build Manager: e.g., npm, Gradle, Yarn

Task Assignments: What each person will work on. Significant code contributions required from everyone.

Embedded Images: All images must be embedded in the wiki and hosted on GitHub.

Readability: Make the wiki easy to read.

For a Web App:
Deployment: How will you deploy? Which hosting providers? Automation? Scripts? Explain.

Development/Deployment Environments: Are you using VMs (VMware) or Containers (Docker)? Explain.

Type of Web App: SPA or traditional, or a mix? Explain.

URLs: List URLs and link each one to the relevant page in your Detailed Design milestone.

REST API: Document if implementing, list methods and parameters, and describe in English.

Views: Embed images from your Design Milestone. Describe each view, like Header, Menu, Content.

Database Schema: List tables/documents with attributes and their types. Describe each table and attribute in English.
